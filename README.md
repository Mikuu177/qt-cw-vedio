# Video Editor/Player - XJCO2811 User Interfaces Assessment

## Project Overview
An enhanced video editor and player application based on the Tomeo application, developed as part of the XJCO2811 User Interfaces module at the University of Leeds.

## Project Goals
- Design and implement a functional video editor/player with advanced features
- Apply UI/UX principles and interaction design lifecycle
- Conduct iterative development with user evaluation
- Create accessible and internationalized interface

## Key Features (Planned)

### Video Playback
- Basic controls: play, pause, fast-forward, rewind, seek
- Variable playback speed (0.5x, 1x, 1.5x, 2x)
- Volume control, mute, and fullscreen mode
- Timeline view with thumbnail preview

### Video Editing
- Trim and cut video clips
- Multi-clip assembly
- Marker points for navigation
- Simple filters and effects
- Export edited videos

### User Interface
- Responsive design for different window sizes
- Accessibility features:
  - Keyboard shortcuts
  - Screen reader support
  - High contrast mode
  - Subtitle display
- Internationalization (English/Chinese)
- Undo/redo functionality

## Technology Stack
- **Framework**: Qt (C++ or PyQt)
- **Video Processing**: QMediaPlayer, FFmpeg
- **Data Storage**: SQLite (for user preferences and project history)
- **UI Design**: Figma/Adobe XD (prototyping)

## Project Timeline

### Iteration 1 (Weeks 1-2)
- Requirement analysis and scenario design
- Lo-fi prototypes
- UI/UX theory research
- First evaluation cycle
- Ethics documentation

### Iteration 2 (Weeks 2-3)
- Hi-fi prototype development
- Core playback features implementation
- Second evaluation cycle
- Accessibility implementation

### Iteration 3 (Weeks 3-4)
- Video editing features
- Internationalization
- Third evaluation cycle
- Performance optimization

### Final Submission (Week 4)
- Documentation and report
- Video demonstrations
- Code cleanup and submission

## Assessment Components
- **Prototype** (20%): Stable, functional application with creative improvements
- **Report** (30%): 6-page documentation covering theory, method, and results
- **Videos** (20%): 3 iteration videos + 1 showcase video
- **Experiments/Iterations** (20%): Three complete evaluation cycles
- **Module Participation** (10%): Peer feedback and engagement

## Team Information
- **Module**: XJCO2811 User Interfaces
- **Submission Deadline**: 04/12/2025 10:00 PM (China time)
- **Repository**: https://github.com/Mikuu177/qt-cw-vedio

## Development Guidelines
